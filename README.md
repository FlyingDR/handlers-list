# Generic list of arbitrary handlers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FlyingDR/handlers-list.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FlyingDR/handlers-list)

This very simple library provides implementation of generic list of arbitrary handlers. 

Its primary goal is to simplify process of organizing multiple related objects into iterable list of handlers with: 

1. Ensuring type correctness by providing class constraint, handlers need to implement / extend
2. Support for defining handlers priority

### Requirements

No dependencies are required, just PHP 7.4 or 8.x.

### Example

```php
interface MyHandler {
    public function doSomething(): void;
}

class Foo implements MyHandler {

}

class Bar implements MyHandler {

}

class Baz extends Bar {

}

// Creating list of handlers
$handlers = new HandlersList([
    new Foo(), 
    new Bar(),
    new Baz(),
], MyHandler::class);

// ... later in code ...
foreach($handlers as $handler) {
    // We can be sure that $handler is of type MyHandler::class
    $handler->doSomething(); 
}
```

In a case if some handler implements `PrioritizedHandlerInterface` - its priority is considered:

```php
interface MyHandler {
    public function name(): string;
}

class A implements MyHandler {
    public function name(): string {
        return 'A';
    }
}

class B implements MyHandler, PrioritizedHandlerInterface {
    public function name(): string {
        return 'B';
    }

    public function getHandlerPriority(): int {
        return 10;
    }
}
 
$handlers = new HandlersList([
    new A(), 
    new B(),
], MyHandler::class);

foreach($handlers as $handler) {
    echo $handler->name() . ' '; 
}
```

Example above will output `B A` because `B` have higher priority then `A` despite the fact that it was put later in the list of handlers. 
     
### Methods

It is, of course, possible to modify list of handlers:
 - `set()` - set new list of handlers
 - `add()` - add a new handler to the list
 - `remove()` - remove given handler from the list
 - `clear()` - remove all handlers from the list

There is also several methods for inspecting list of handlers:
 - `isEmpty()` - check if handlers list is empty
 - `count()` - get number of handlers in the list
 - `accepts()` - check if list accepts a given object or objects of given cass  
 - `contains()` - check if given handler is available in the list
 - `filter()` - filter handlers list using provided test callable and return array of matching handlers
 - `find()` - searches for a handler using provided callable
 - `getIterator()` - get handlers from the list as iterator
 - `toArray()` - get handlers from the list as array

And remaining methods:
 - `getConstraint()` - get class constraint that is applied to handlers in this list  

### Immutable handlers list

Besides default, mutable implementation of handlers list there is also immutable version: `ImmutableHandlersList`. Its functionality is completely same in except of list modification methods that returns new copy of the list instead of modifying original one.
